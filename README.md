Test drive Docker images on any infrastructure

There are docker images for builds that are available in docker repository. We will only focus on public repositories. We list the repositories and any chosen repository could be deployed on any cloud. Now this could be run on your local machine too.
But when you are vetting a service, as to how it looks and works, you may need to manually set up the service through multiple steps.
