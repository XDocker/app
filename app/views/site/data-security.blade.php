At xDocker we make it a priority to keep the client data safe through a defined system of vigorous security practices.  Below are some of the reasons why we can confidently assure you that your data will be secure with Xervmon:

<strong>Secure Data Centers</strong>

At Xervmon we store our data with some of the most reputable data centers on the market today, such as Microsoft Azure and AWS. These data centers are both certified with ISO/IEC 27001:2005, SAS70 Type II compliance as well as the PCI DSS Level 1 compliance.

If you want to find out more about the security practices at these data centers read, read here for AWS and here for Microsoft Azure.

<strong>Encrypted Data</strong>

To maximize secure data handling and storage, we encrypt all data processed through Xervmon. Our encryption techniques are highly-developed to ensure that our data is processed in the most secure manner and protected from all threats.

Strict Access Controls

To further ensure that your date is securely stored and processed, we employ a wide range of strict access controls. One of the access controls includes provisioning, which results in our employees being granted the lowest level of system access relevant to their job function.

A further access control we are using is that our employees are unable to decrypt your encrypted account data.

Vigorous Vulnerability Reporting Program

To always ensure that our data security measures are successfully, we employ an active vulnerability reporting program. Through this program we ensure to actively seek any possible vulnerability in the system, and report them. To find out more about our vulnerability reporting procedures read here.

At Xervmon, we want you to be confident in our trustworthiness, and for this reason we have strong partnerships with two of the most reliable names on the market such as AWS and Microsoft. 

Xervmon holds the official positions of a Microsoft BizSpark Network Partner and an AWS APN Technology Partner.

 

HIPAA Sensitive Environments

Your data is secure with Xervmon as our product is designed to work under HIPAA sensitive environments requirements. Although HIPAA does not provide an official certification for any SaaS solution, we have carefully designed out tool to ensure that it fulfills the requirements of the HIPAA. Alternatively, you could subscribe for on-premise version of Xervmon

This means that there will be no type of access to your actual data, and no one at Xervmon will be able to access any data you store in the cloud.

Although the HIPAA /HiTECH structure, recently released by Omnibus, would not define Xervmon as a ‘business associate’ or organization that met the HIPAA security standards, we have ensured that our product is developed to be able to work under the HIPAA sensitive environment requirements.

To find out more about HIPAA Data security you read the official website or email us at at security@xervmon.com.

At Xervmon, we take full responsibility for your data security, and we are always proactive to improve and develop our systems and procedures.
